# Qworum's Netlify Build Plugin

Checks whether the website that is being deployed on Netlify is entitled to use
the [Qworum](https://qworum.net) frontend platform.

This prevents runtime errors in production for deployed websites that rely on
Qworum.

## How to install

This build plugin to your website from the
[Netlify Integrations page](https://app.netlify.com/plugins).
