[![Qworum's Netlify Build Plugin](Qworum-plus-Netlify.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/plugins/@qworum/netlify-plugin-qworum/install)

This is a template for a multi-language website that:

- uses [Qworum](https://qworum.net)'s advanced web browser capabilities, and
- is deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

## A Qworum-based web application

This website implements a Qworum API that has 2 endpoints:

- the `home` endpoint, which is an application, and
- the `view-item` endpoint, called by `home`.

Here is the directory structure:

- Directories with 2-letter names such as `en` contain language-specific versions of the API endpoints.
- `assets` contains resources used by the web pages.
- All other directories (`home`, `view-item`) are used for redirecting API calls to language-specific endpoint versions.

Note that the API endpoint names mustn't be:

- 2 letters long,
- equal to `assets`.

## Verify that Qworum is activated for your website

Using Qworum's Netlify build plugin is recommended in order to ensure that your website will only be deployed if it is entitled to use Qworum.

[Add the Qworum plugin to your website's build process directly from Netlify's Integration Hub](https://app.netlify.com/plugins/@qworum/netlify-plugin-qworum/install).
