# Settings in the [build] context are global and are applied to
# all contexts unless otherwise overridden by more specific contexts.

# ⚠️⚠️⚠️ If a build setting is commented out, then Netlify will fall back on the setting
# that was specified on https://app.netlify.com/sites/PROJECT/settings/deploys,
# and if that setting is empty, then it will use the default setting (no build command, etc).
[build]
  # Directory to change to before starting a build.
  # This is where we will look for package.json/.nvmrc/etc.
  # If not set, defaults to the root directory.
  # base = "project/"
  base = "." 

  # Directory that contains the deploy-ready HTML files and
  # assets generated by the build. This is relative to the base
  # directory if one has been set, or the root directory if
  # a base has not been set. This sample publishes the directory
  # located at the absolute path "root/project/dist"
  publish = "dist"

  # Default build command.
  # command = "npm run build" # Uncomment this if you wish Netlify to build your project for you.
